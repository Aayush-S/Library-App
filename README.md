# Library-TOP

Library app that keeps track of books the user inputs.

Learning Retro:

- Had a great time with this project. Tons of fun and kept on wanting to go back after breaks
- Learned more about using the DOM and events
- More practice with styling and had a decent outcome design wise (still need more practice)
- Learned how to implement an Object and use its properties
- Used the prototype system on the Book object (though might need more practice with this one)
- Learned how to use localStorage (Super cool!!!)
